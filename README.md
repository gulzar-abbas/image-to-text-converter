### Adding Real OCR Functionality
Replace the `processImage()` function with actual OCR integration:
```javascript
function processImage(imageSrc) {
    // Replace with real OCR API call
    // Example: Tesseract.js, Google Vision API, etc.
}
```

### Customizing Animations
Modify animation durations and effects in the CSS:
```css
@keyframes glow {
    from { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 10px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)); }
    to { filter: drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)); }
}
